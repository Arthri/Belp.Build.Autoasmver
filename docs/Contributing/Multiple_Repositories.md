# Multiple Repositories
Belp uses multiple repositories: each project has its own repository. While a monolithic repository is convenient for managing multiple projects, Belp's projects follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), which is difficult to implement and manage in a monolithic repository. Furthermore, Belp is not yet at the scale where monolithic versioning is justifiable.
